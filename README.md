**objective**

The objective of this project is to predict the book's rating thanks to the different variables of our database. We followed several steps to reach this goal.

Installation

The python notebook files in this repo should run with Anaconda distribution of Python versions 3.*.

To explore this project please download the dataset (books.csv) and the python notebook. You can either upload the files using Jupyter notebook which will automatically place these files in the current working directory of your Python installation or place these files in the current working directory and then run the notebook.

**libraries Used:**

Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn

Jupyter Notebook File Descriptions

**Data cleaning**

In a first step we cleaned the data:

-Checking of null values

-Checking the dates that do not respect the correct format or that have outliers

-Checking of numeric fields that have alphabetic fields

**Feature selection :**

Once our database is clean we proceed to the selection of our variables. We then created other variables from existing variables, while justifying and conducting a logical reasoning

**Data explanatory:**

Our data being clean and our variables selected, we have therefore proceeded to the exploitation of our data through descriptive statistics thanks to tables and graphs. This part allowed us to deepen our knowledge about the data and to prepare how we could predict the variable of interest.
